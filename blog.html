    My first Blog Post </h3>
    <h6>Wednesday, September 25 2024</h6>
    <p>
      Hey everyone! Welcome to my inner thought muah ha ha. I've always had alot of thought and alot of 
      strong opinions, so here goes nothing. I think many people in this generation underestimate the 
      power of their thoughts and the power of sharing their thoughts. I'm not talking about the people 
      who overshare on instagram and tiktok (this post is not for yall), but rather I am talking about 
      those of us who get annoyed when we see uncles gathered around drinking attaya and talking about 
      the lastest political news back home. I'm talking to those of us who hate seeing the aunties gather 
      together because we do it'll be a whole lotta chit chat about nothing. I'm talking to those of us who 
      no longer find joy in seeing the jalis at every event. 
    </p>
      <p>
      Unfortuneately, we are often hyperfocused on maximization and optimization. Always trying to make
      the next dolloar. Always trying to make the next job promotion. Always trying to come up with the
      next big patent. We figure, if it doesn't maximize profit or optimize production, then it must not
      be worth our time. 
          </p>
      <p>
      I might just be yapping here but what if... the sky isn't falling. What if the weight of the world
      isn't on our shoulders alone. As our uncles sit and drink attaya, do we realize how many of them
      witnessed the decolinazation of their lands? Do we realize that they saw dictators rise and fall.
      Do we realize that they've seen their family members be wisked away simply because they spoke out
      against the government. Making and serving attay can take HOURS. Maybe, just maybe, these few hours
      of discussion while drinking a potent green tea that aides in digestion, weight loss, and 
      diabetes managemnt, is their way of avenging <em>their</em> uncles who weren't able to speak up out of 
      fear of imprisonment. 
          </p>
      <p>Alhamdulilah for the education I have today as a young woman of African descent. While representation 
      is increasing, many of our mothers and even more of our grandmothers never even came close to this kind
      of education. My grandmother never attended formal education (I used to help her practice how to write
      her name when I was 7) yet she complains about micro-organisms when we leave food out for too long, 
      knows every detail of every CNN headline, can tell you more about American politics than the average
      natural-born American, and can shop in every currency in the world. Without schooling, without formal 
      education, how did she become so knowledgeable? Through conversation. Through dialogue. Through learning
      when it was okay to take a step back from her nornam activites to listen to those around her. Yes, our
      aunties can definitely overtalk, but for many of them, the hours and hours that they spend on Whatsapp
      is the only way for them to learn about what's going on in the world and to gain some intellectual 
      autonomy.</p>
    <p>
        Jaliya or griots, are an important part of West African culture. A jali is essentially a storyteller,
        historian, musician, poet, or praisesinger. Every family is assigned a jali who knows and recites
        their family history. As many West African tribes do not have written languages, jalis are essential 
        in the preservation of our history. Nowadays, it does become frustrating when jalis are demanding money
        before, during, and after their performances, but that's no reason for our generation to lose ties with
        this ancient part of our culture. Without jalis, most of us wouldn't know where we came from and certainly
        wouldn't know where we are going. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I say all this to say that dialogue and conversation are important. It is through our conversations 
        that we learn to be human, learn about humans, and learn humanity. It doesn't matter if you aren't
        discussing how to make a million dollars or if you're debating a hot political topic. What matters
        is that we keep ideas circulating throughout the world because you never know how much someone 
        could learn from you or how liberated one can feel by pouring out whatever's on their mind. 
        Now, the style in which we converse is important. To engage in truth, to talk with humility and 
        kindness, and to conduct ourselves in a respectful way are always things to keep in mind. Here's 
        to me and my fellow yappers. May our yap sessions continue to tell the stories of generations for
        generations to come.

    Worth </h3>
    <h6>Monday, September 20 2024</h6>
    <p> 
        At times I feel like I’m not deserving of what I’ve earned. Like I frauded my way into it. Like I stole it from someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
Did I get it because I’m black? A woman? A black woman? I’m a failure so why do I deserve anything in life.
    </p>
    <p>
But then I realize
    </p>
    <p>
There were other black people who applied and were denied. Other women who applied and were denied. And although often few, there were other black women who applied, and were denied.
    </p>
    <p>
Maybe that’s just it. My constant awareness of self and the world is what people see in me and why they push for my success and celebrate my accolades.
    </p>
    <p>
“to be relatively conscious is to be in a state of rage almost all of the time” but let me not rage myself. Let me rage the systems that forced me to do the work that got the accolade in the first place. The lack of racial justice. The lack of community. Let me turn that rage into passion, or continue to do so
    </p>
    <p>
Maybe I am worthy. Maybe I should be loved. Maybe I should be celebrated. Maybe God never makes mistakes and maybe He didn’t start with me. Alhamdulilah for this journey I’m on. Gracious and humbled, a crown needed not, but it does look good in the photo op

I look to my brother on the right and say assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you) <br>
I look to my brother on the left and say wa alaikum assalam (and peace be upon you)<br>
But I look to my brother in front of me<br>
And see right through him<br>
Burma, Syria, Yemen, and Palestine<br>
Tamir, Eric, Michael and Freddie<br>
        </p>
        <p>
Yes<br>
All lives matter<br>
All lives have always mattered<br>
But we have forgotten those three words<br>
And now live in a world where my brother has to hold signs saying his life matters<br>
For what<br>
 </p>
        <p>
They take the depressed stop letting them be professed so they can be oppressed<br>
Put them in a corner<br>
Then box them up for life<br>
What kind of world do we live in<br>
THAT my brother must tell the world<br>
HE MATTERS<br>
For we have had too many martyrs<br>
 </p>
        <p>
Burma, Syria, Yemen, and Palestine<br>
Tamir, Eric, Michael and Freddie<br>
They say love is stronger than hate<br>
But have you heard hate<br>
Have you heard it creeping up your front yard<br>
Have you heard it grasp you by the neck and never let go<br>
Have you smelt it burn down your house<br>
 </p>
        <p>
They say love is stronger than hate<br>
But is it love that drops bombs<br>
Is it love that brands the terrorized as terrorist<br>
Is it love that fries the mind<br>
Rids all happiness from it<br>
So it can never rewind<br>
To the glory days<br>
 </p>
        <p>
I look to my brother on the right and say assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you)<br>
I look to my brother on the left and say wa alaikum assalam (and peace be upon you)<br>
But I look to my brother in front of me<br>
And see right through him<br>
The blood gushing through his face<br>
His mother yearning for his smile<br>
But that has been lost<br>
Lost to the perpetuated lines of guns, violence, and anguish<br>
I see right through that<br>

“Good morning”<br>
“Good night”<br>
Oh my goodness… that means he likes me!<br>
Many of us have watched our mothers and grandmothers’ relationships be the result of struggle<br>
Of pain, of adultery, of abuse<br>
But even after the dust of the relation has settled,<br>
We continue to settle<br>
Plagued by the same “if you love me don’t leave me”s<br>
And “I’m sorry, I’ve changed”<br>
We keep settling<br>
Expecting words over actions as if those words will feed our children<br>
As if even God, with all his mercy, only takes words over actions<br>
Why do we settle?<br>
Is it because we’re unlovable<br>
Or simply unloved.<br>
Low value?<br>
Or never valued enough<br>
We try to make sense of senseless men since no one taught us better<br>
Because no one showed us better<br>
They would trade a dime for a few cents, it just doesn’t make sense.<br>
But alas,<br>
I’ll burn my sage and incense<br>
And leave the rest in the past tense<br>

            <h3>
                30 Things I've Learned in my First 30 Days at Work
            </h3>
            <p>
                I started my first big girl job!!! YAY! #CORPORATE. My job title is "technically" 
                hardware development engineer, but I'm a manufacturing engineer for Amazon's Project Kuiper. As a manufacturing enigneer,
                I develop new processes for getting my line replaceable unit (LRU) to integration as quick, safe,
                and as controlled as possible. Here are 30 things I've learned in my first 30 days of work.
                <ol>
                    <li>No one know what they are doing <br> Everyone is making mistakes ALL THE TIME. They don't let it
                        upset them, so why should you? The whole point of working with a team is so we can check each other
                        with our diverse talents to produce products and devices that we're proud of. From communication to leadership to
                    having a better understanding of new technology as a recent grad, we offer some value and can easily
                    contribute to the team with whatever niche talent we have.</li>
                  
                    <li>It's okay to have work friends <br> We spend a third of our day at work, it'd be ridiculous to always stay 
                    to yourself in a corner all day. It important to have people you trust at work who can answer your questions, give 
                    you advice, and can lift your spirits if you're having a work related issue</li>
                    
                    <li>Be mindful <br> Just because you have "work friends" doesn't mean they need to be your best friends. 
                    There are definitely some topics or personal details that you do not need to discuss at work or with your 
                    work collegues even outside of work. You don't want to offend anyone, step on anyone's toes, or have aspects
                    of your personal life misinterpreted or misused against you</li>
                    
                    <li>Take breaks <br> If you're an hourly employee working an 8-hour shift, you're legally entitiled to at least
                    a 30-minute lunch break and 2 15-minute breaks. This is law because as humans, we need to take care of ourselves. We cannot 
                        work ourselves to death. As a salaried employee, no one is tracking my time, but that also
                    means no one is tracking my breaks. There are alot of apps that you can connect to your phone or smart watch to remind
                    you to take breaks. Take time to recuperate, eat a healthy meal, and realign your mental. You'll be a better
                    employee for it</li>
                   
                    <li>Ask for help <br> Everyone might seem busy, but it'll take a seasoned employee a fraction of the 
                    time to walk you through something than if you were to do it yourself. Asking questions also builds trust
                    because now your team members know that you'd rather ask questions and get it right, than to be arrogant, thinking
                    that you know everything, then make a huge mistake</li>
                   
                    <li>Stay involved in the community <br> In college, there are community engagements all around us, but as an adult, 
                    we have to be more intentional about how we want to spend our time. Find different non profits to volunteer with, 
                    or even get involved in employee resource groups (ERGs). ERGs are almost exactly like college affinity groups, but 
                    they work in the sphere of your company</li>
                    
                    <li>Health is wealth. <br> We getting up there in age unfortunately. It's time to take care of ourselves. 
                    Make time to go to the gym or get some kind of physical activity in everyday and try to have healthy food options around you.
                    A body in motion stays in motion</li>
                    
                    <li>Keep up with different skills and hobbies <br> It's not good to make a single job or project the sole bain 
                    of your existence. Try to keep your mind sharp in other areas. You can either ask to be put on stretch projects at
                    work which are basically projects from a different team that they need some assistance with or you can pick hobbie
                    outside of work (like making your own websites). Trust me, it's so much easier to learn without the pressure of school, so just
                    pick something up and try learning it little by little</li>
                    
                    <li>Keep in contact with friends and family <br> What's the point of making all of this money if you have no one
                    to share it with? Personally, I dedicate at least one day a week (usually Sunday) to just make sure I hit up my long
                    distance cousins especially and keep up with my close circles. I do this because it's easy to get so caught up in your own life
                    and if you don't make sincere intention to keep the bonds with friends and family, you'll slowly start to lose the support system
                    that got you to this place in the first place</li>
                    
                    <li>Alhamdulilah always <br> In this day and age, there is more wrong with the world than right, but always rememver to have
                    gratitude and contentment. Allah will always remember us if we remmeber him and he'll never leave us if we never leave him. 
                    Any failure or hardship we go through is an opportunity to learn and/or have our sins erased, so anything you go through, just remember to say
                    Alhamdulilah</li>
                   
                    <li>Don't tolerate disrespect in the workplace<br>There is a way to approach people if their
                    actions or words are offending. Seek out guidance for how to handle the situation, especially if it is sensitive, and sometimes,
                    the other person doesn't even know they are being offensive and it might not have been their intention, so try to speak with people respectfully. 
                    If it's something you think you cannot or should not have to handle on your own, your manager or HR team should provide you with resources. But know
                    that being disrespected was not part of the job description.</li>
                    
                    <li>Don't abandon your morals and principles <br> As a muslim, I'm obligated to pray 5 times a day at 
                    specified times. If I wait until after work, I would have missed so many prayers. While I can make them up later,
                    if I can pray them on time, I should. Many office spaces these days have interfaith prayer rooms and you shouldn't feel
                    any shame about using that resource. While everyone else is taking their break in the cafe, use your breaks to go and pray on time. 
                    It'll be good for your mental health and it is a huge investment in your hereafter. If your office doesn't have this space, then
                    you can reserve a conference room and pray there when you need it. People reserve conference rooms all the time if they need a quiet
                    place to themselves; you are no different</li>
                   
                    <li>Pick and choose your battles <br> As a new employee, I'm still trying to understand the value streams and how everyone's
                    role fits in with one another. If you feel like someone is giving you work outside of your scope or capabilities, before 
                    complaining and making an enemy out of that person, try to schedule a quick conversation with them about where this work is coming
                    from and try to understand their point of view. If you feel like you're not being heard, seek out advice from either your manager 
                    or work friends</li>
                  
                    <li>Touch grass <br> Get away from the screens and bright lights. It's going to kill your
                    eyesight</li>
                    
                    <li>Enroll in your benefits<br> If you're going to give so much of your time and energy to a company, 
                    make sure you are taking full advantage of the benefits <em>they offer</em>. As muslims or anyone that 
                    doesn't deal with interest, there are even interest free versions of 401k accounts, so if your company
                    will match your contribution AND there's no interest, that's just free money for you. Enroll in healthcare, dental,
                    vision, etc. It's super cheap through your job and if you're still on your parents' plan but you're not getting the treatment
                    you need, it might be best to swith over to the company one. There's also loads of discount codes, promotions, and perks
                    that you might be eligible for so always make sure you thoroughly go through your company's benefits page</li>
                  
                    <li>Advocate for yourself <br> You have to learn to speak up!!! If you want to switch projects, or spend time
                    shadowing a different team, or even just to ask for your PTO, you HAVE to speak up. Let your manager know where your 
                    head is at and what your needs are. If you're the more introverted type and you have trouble with this, seek out guidance from 
                    trusted mentors or friends who have already been through this</li>
                    
                    <li>Seek out mentors <br> You may not always get the CEO's time, but there definitely is at lease <em>one</em> person
                    in your organization who is willing to take 30 minutes to an hour out of their week to meet with you to answer your 
                    questions about the company or to give you general career development advice. No one is above asking help, and as someone
                    who's fresh in the industry, people will appreciate you taking the innitiative to learn from those around you.</li>
                   
                    <li>Find your style <br> When you look good, you feel good. Invest some energy in finding comfortable work
                    clothes that fit your style. Having prepared outfits will save you so much time in the morning and will boost
                    your confidence when your walk into the office</li>
                    
                    <li>Kill 'em with kindness <br> It takes nothing to be kind to others, so just be kind. I'm not saying be a pushover
                    or bake cookies for everyone, but bringing good energy into your workplace will make people more receptive to listening 
                    to you and working with you. No one wants to work with someone cranky all the time. Smile, say good morning, and speak respectfully.</li>
                   
                    <li>Expect the unexpected <br> If you want to work at a FAANG, you're going to learn pretty quickly that these 
                    companies are always on go and always making changes. A process that was approved in the morning, could be obsolete by the 
                    next day. Be ready for rapid change and don't be afraid to seek advice on how to deal with those changes</li>
                    
                    <li>Don't take everything so personally <br> A lot of your coworkers are dealing with issues that you would
                    never even imagine, so have grace for them. If they don't return your greeting, maybe they were so busy thinking of 
                    their own issues that they didn't even notice you. Now, their personal problems are not an excuse to be blatantly disrespectful,
                    but don't make a mountain out of every molehill. If someone is giving your feedback or critizing your work, remember that it is just that;
                    critism on the WORK, and not you as a personal. Use that feedback and critism to enhance your skills and come back with something even
                    better</li>
