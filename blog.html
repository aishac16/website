    My first Blog Post <br>

      Hey everyone! Welcome to my inner thought muah ha ha. I've always had alot of thought <br>
      and alot of strong opinions, so here goes nothing. I think many people in this generation <br>
      underestimate the power of their thoughts and the power of sharing their thoughts. I'm not <br>
      talking about the people who overshare on instagram and tiktok (this post is not for yall),<br>
      but rather I am talking about those of us who get annoyed when we see uncles gathered around <br>
      drinking attaya and talking about the lastest political news back home. I'm talking to those <br>
      of us who hate seeing the aunties gather together because we do it'll be a whole lotta chit <br>
      chat about nothing. I'm talking to those of us who no longer find joy in seeing the jalis at<br>
      every event. 
      <br>

      Unfortuneately, we are often hyperfocused on maximization and optimization. Always trying to make
      the next dolloar. Always trying to make the next job promotion. Always trying to come up with the
      next big patent. We figure, if it doesn't maximize profit or optimize production, then it must not
      be worth our time. 
      <br>
      I might just be yapping here but what if... the sky isn't falling. What if the weight of the world
      isn't on our shoulders alone. As our uncles sit and drink attaya, do we realize how many of them
      witnessed the decolinazation of their lands? Do we realize that they saw dictators rise and fall.
      Do we realize that they've seen their family members be wisked away simply because they spoke out
      against the government. Making and serving attay can take HOURS. Maybe, just maybe, these few hours
      of discussion while drinking a potent green tea that aides in digestion, weight loss, and 
      diabetes managemnt, is their way of avenging <em>their</em> uncles who weren't able to speak up out of 
      fear of imprisonment.

      Alhamdulilah for the education I have today as a young woman of African descent. While representation 
      is increasing, many of our mothers and even more of our grandmothers never even came close to this kind
      of education. My grandmother never attended formal education (I used to help her practice how to write
      her name when I was 7) yet she complains about micro-organisms when we leave food out for too long, 
      knows every detail of every CNN headline, can tell you more about American politics than the average
      natural-born American, and can shop in every currency in the world. Without schooling, without formal 
      education, how did she become so knowledgeable? Through conversation. Through dialogue. Through learning
      when it was okay to take a step back from her nornam activites to listen to those around her. Yes, our
      aunties can definitely overtalk, but for many of them, the hours and hours that they spend on Whatsapp
      is the only way for them to learn about what's going on in the world and to gain some intellectual 
      autonomy.
