    My first Blog Post </h3>
    <h6>Wednesday, September 25 2024</h6>
    <p>
      Hey everyone! Welcome to my inner thought muah ha ha. I've always had alot of thought and alot of 
      strong opinions, so here goes nothing. I think many people in this generation underestimate the 
      power of their thoughts and the power of sharing their thoughts. I'm not talking about the people 
      who overshare on instagram and tiktok (this post is not for yall), but rather I am talking about 
      those of us who get annoyed when we see uncles gathered around drinking attaya and talking about 
      the lastest political news back home. I'm talking to those of us who hate seeing the aunties gather 
      together because we do it'll be a whole lotta chit chat about nothing. I'm talking to those of us who 
      no longer find joy in seeing the jalis at every event. 
    </p>
      <p>
      Unfortuneately, we are often hyperfocused on maximization and optimization. Always trying to make
      the next dolloar. Always trying to make the next job promotion. Always trying to come up with the
      next big patent. We figure, if it doesn't maximize profit or optimize production, then it must not
      be worth our time. 
          </p>
      <p>
      I might just be yapping here but what if... the sky isn't falling. What if the weight of the world
      isn't on our shoulders alone. As our uncles sit and drink attaya, do we realize how many of them
      witnessed the decolinazation of their lands? Do we realize that they saw dictators rise and fall.
      Do we realize that they've seen their family members be wisked away simply because they spoke out
      against the government. Making and serving attay can take HOURS. Maybe, just maybe, these few hours
      of discussion while drinking a potent green tea that aides in digestion, weight loss, and 
      diabetes managemnt, is their way of avenging <em>their</em> uncles who weren't able to speak up out of 
      fear of imprisonment. 
          </p>
      <p>Alhamdulilah for the education I have today as a young woman of African descent. While representation 
      is increasing, many of our mothers and even more of our grandmothers never even came close to this kind
      of education. My grandmother never attended formal education (I used to help her practice how to write
      her name when I was 7) yet she complains about micro-organisms when we leave food out for too long, 
      knows every detail of every CNN headline, can tell you more about American politics than the average
      natural-born American, and can shop in every currency in the world. Without schooling, without formal 
      education, how did she become so knowledgeable? Through conversation. Through dialogue. Through learning
      when it was okay to take a step back from her nornam activites to listen to those around her. Yes, our
      aunties can definitely overtalk, but for many of them, the hours and hours that they spend on Whatsapp
      is the only way for them to learn about what's going on in the world and to gain some intellectual 
      autonomy.</p>
    <p>
        Jaliya or griots, are an important part of West African culture. A jali is essentially a storyteller,
        historian, musician, poet, or praisesinger. Every family is assigned a jali who knows and recites
        their family history. As many West African tribes do not have written languages, jalis are essential 
        in the preservation of our history. Nowadays, it does become frustrating when jalis are demanding money
        before, during, and after their performances, but that's no reason for our generation to lose ties with
        this ancient part of our culture. Without jalis, most of us wouldn't know where we came from and certainly
        wouldn't know where we are going. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I say all this to say that dialogue and conversation are important. It is through our conversations 
        that we learn to be human, learn about humans, and learn humanity. It doesn't matter if you aren't
        discussing how to make a million dollars or if you're debating a hot political topic. What matters
        is that we keep ideas circulating throughout the world because you never know how much someone 
        could learn from you or how liberated one can feel by pouring out whatever's on their mind. 
        Now, the style in which we converse is important. To engage in truth, to talk with humility and 
        kindness, and to conduct ourselves in a respectful way are always things to keep in mind. Here's 
        to me and my fellow yappers. May our yap sessions continue to tell the stories of generations for
        generations to come.

    Worth </h3>
    <h6>Monday, September 20 2024</h6>
    <p> 
        At times I feel like I’m not deserving of what I’ve earned. Like I frauded my way into it. Like I stole it from someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
Did I get it because I’m black? A woman? A black woman? I’m a failure so why do I deserve anything in life.
    </p>
    <p>
But then I realize
    </p>
    <p>
There were other black people who applied and were denied. Other women who applied and were denied. And although often few, there were other black women who applied, and were denied.
    </p>
    <p>
Maybe that’s just it. My constant awareness of self and the world is what people see in me and why they push for my success and celebrate my accolades.
    </p>
    <p>
“to be relatively conscious is to be in a state of rage almost all of the time” but let me not rage myself. Let me rage the systems that forced me to do the work that got the accolade in the first place. The lack of racial justice. The lack of community. Let me turn that rage into passion, or continue to do so
    </p>
    <p>
Maybe I am worthy. Maybe I should be loved. Maybe I should be celebrated. Maybe God never makes mistakes and maybe He didn’t start with me. Alhamdulilah for this journey I’m on. Gracious and humbled, a crown needed not, but it does look good in the photo op
