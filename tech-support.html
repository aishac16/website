            "Is it worth it?"
        </h2>
        <p>
            College is a huge committment. You have to <em>choose</em> to apply <em>choose</em> to pay for the 
            application <em>choose</em> to accept to attend the univeristy <em>choose</em> to apply for your major
            <em>choose</em> to pay tuition every term for 4+ years, and for those of us who are unlucky, <em>choose</em> 
            to take out thousands in student loans. I don't even choose what I eat for dinner and yet we are supposed
            to make decisions for the next 4 years that'll change our next 4 decades. From the burden of choice to 
            the everyday struggles we endure because we <em>chose</em> college, it often feels like it's not worth it.
            We may see our friends earning more money than us by doing questionable things, or getting taken out by their
            sugar daddies, and want the same. I too want to shake my ass on a yacht, in dubai, in a thong.

            Firstly, Alhamdulilah and all praise to the Most High for even having the ability to choose. At this time,
            all 16 universities in Gaza have been destroyed, women's rights to education are being limited in Afghanistan, 
            and students all over the world are being displaced due to conflict. We have to first remember to be grateful
            for having so many attainable options at our feet, even if the path looks gloomy at first.

            When life gives you lemons, some people make lemonade, some people pummel others with hard lemons, and some
            simply let the lemons rot in their fruit basket. Life is what you make out of it so the question isn't "is it
            worth it". The question should be "is it worth it for you and what will you make out of it?" There are students
            who go to graduate school for 5-6 years to attain a PhD and have a starting salary of $200k and there are others
            who go into industry right after bachelor's and get enough promotions after 5-6 years of working to make $200k.
            Both situations <em>can</em> get to the end goal of $200,000 but it depends on what you're valuing along the 
            journey.

            If you feel like you didn't learn enough in college but really liked being able to attend lectures, have the 
            support of faculty and staff, have assignments that keep you accountable, and be around a community of lifelong
            learners, then maybe academia is the route for you. But if you love learning and simply couldn't keep up with 
            the coursework, felt burnt out every single day after school, and never really found a singular niche or research
            project that you wouldn't mind focusing on for the next 5-6 years, then maybe academia isn't for you.
        </p>

            If you loved your internship experiences, like the idea of pushing out products to customers in a short period of
            time, need money rolling in on a steady and consistent basis, and enjoy the corporate baddie lifestyle, then maybe
            industry is for you. But if you found your internships to be draining, you worked on projects that you couldn't put
            your heart into, or your morals and values don't align with those of these companies, then maybe industry isn't for you.
        </p>

            There is no one single path to success and no ones path is linear. You can try industry and after a few years of 
            making coin, go back to school. It literally does not set you back because you are only in competition with the 
            best version of yourself. Every opportunity is what you make of it, so really take some time to think if you have
            the physical, mental, and financial strength to go through a certain path. Seek out mentors, talk to people who 
            are in positions that you are considering, and know that if you're smart enough to ask these questions at a young
            age, then your smart enough to always find success in any path that you choose :).
